# Story Proofs, Axoims of Probability
- try edge cases, different cases, simple and extreme cases (plug in different numbers)
- finding the simplest non - trivial case
- label everything

- E.g. pick k times from set of n objects, where order doesnt matter with replacement
    - Ans: $ {n+k-1 \choose k}$
    - Extreme cases:
        - k = 0 =>  $ {n-1 \choose 0}$ = 1
        - k = 1 => $ {n \choose 1}$ = n
        - n = 2 => $  {k+1 \choose k}$ = k + 1
    - Better way to think about it:
        - how many ways are there to put k indistinguishable particles in n boxes?
            - $ * * *  | | * * | $
            - there must be k $*$ 's and n -1 |'s
            - ${n+k-1 \choose k} = {n+k-1 \choose n-1}$ 
- Story proofs:
    - ${n \choose k} = {n \choose k-1}$
    - application / proof by interpretation:
        - think about what it means than using factoraisl
    - ${n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k}$
    - 2. $ n {n-1 \choose k-1} = k {n \choose k}$
    - Interpretation:
        - Pick $k$ people out of $n$, with 1 designated as president
        - Left side: you pick the president first then pick the k people you want to select to be in your club
        - Count the same thing in 2 ways
    - 3. ${m+n \choose k} = {\Sigma_{j=0}^{k} {m \choose j} {n \choose k-j}}$
        -  Interpretation:
            - thinking about it as still picking k people out of m+n  amount of people
            - m can mean 1 group of ppl, n can mean another group of ppl
            - m: * * * 
            - n: * * * * 
- Non-naive definition: probability sample consists of $S$ and $P$
    - $S$ is sample space
    - $P$ is a function which takes an event $A \subset S$ as input. returns $P(A) \in [0,1]$ as outputs 
    - 2 axioms:
        - $P(\phi) = 0$
            - what does it mean to have an empty set?
                - we want impossible events to have probability of 0
        - $P(S) = 1$:
            - $P(\cup^\infty A_n) = \Sigma_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n)$ **iff** $P(A_1), P(A_2), P(A_3)...$ are disjoint, they dont overlap
